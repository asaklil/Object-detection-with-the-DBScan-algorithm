# Object-detection-with-the-DBScan-algorithm
Part1: Implementation a data clustering algorithm named DBSCAN -(Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).

Part2: Creation of a program that detects objects (clusters of points in fact) in a scene captured by a LiDAR (a laser scanner)
